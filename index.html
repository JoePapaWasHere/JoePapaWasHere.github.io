		JOE PAPA WAS HERE
		<h1>A bit about me</h1>
		<p> Howdy. I'm Joe Papa an alumni from Stony Brook University where I recieved a BE and MS in Computer Engineering. 
		During my time at Stony Brook I fell in love with digital design particulary digital design using FPGA's and HDLs. While that is what I do for my dayjob, 
        I always like to learn new skills and become a better engineer. That is why I started this website. It is my "Digital Playground" to learn about web dev, git and more
		and be able to share it with the world. Thanks for tagging along on this journey. If you'd like to learn more about me professionally, check out my linkedin linked below.</p>
